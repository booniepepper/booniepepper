üá¨üá∫ H√•fa Adai! üèù

Welcome to my polyglot programming adventures.

I'm currently most interested in:

- Software supply chain technologies
- Anything related to terminal emulators, shells, and command-line computing
- Concatenative programming languages
- Embedded engineering

If you're interested in these things too, reach out to me as booniepepper on Discord, or justin(at)so.dang.cool via email.

"Boonie Peppers" are thin spicy chili peppers that grow in the boonies in Guam, where I was born. (Non-military family, although I did enlist in the USMC when I was 21)
